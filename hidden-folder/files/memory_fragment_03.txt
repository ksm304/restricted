Have you ever wondered how you'd taste like? 
Eh, I did, you'd taste
Like sweet sugary treats
Pleasing my palate, sliding into
My throat. Tight, tight, it's closing on M
E, on me, on you, on them? 
Pray tell, 	i	 shall 
Love yur taste, 
Elaborate it, 
Aiming to taste the
Same, the same. We are the same 
Ephemeral beings, anomalies. Unwanted.

I miss your taste, you ta
STE? Have I ever tasted? No, 
Ever longing for thy taste. 
Ever yearning for thy taste. 
Your taste, your smell, drawn am I to 
Our bond. it may exist. It may not. 
Ur all I have, Miles, or Jess?
